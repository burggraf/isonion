## [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com) [Angular](https://angular.io) Demo App for [Supabase](https://supabase.io)

This is a fun little game called "Onion or Not?" where the object is to determine whether a given headline is from the (fake) satrical new site [The Onion](https://www.theonion.com) or from the Subreddit [Not the Onion](https://www.reddit.com/r/nottheonion), which is filled with bizarre, yet true news stories.
